# removeWhiteSpace
A little tool to turn all white space transparent, I have to do this often at work, so this seemed to be solid course of action.

# To do
Make file executable or turn this into a website that handles this process

# Usage (I know its bad right now, will fix)
``` git clone https://github.com/Mrchadparkour/removeWhiteSpace.git```
``` npm install ```
``` cd removeWhiteSpace ```
``` npm run start <path/to/image> ```
